## 📄 Overview

This research explores the **usability and effectiveness of Learning Management Systems (LMS)** in supporting virtual learning for students. With the rapid shift to online education, understanding whether LMS platforms truly enhance the student learning experience is critical.

Using an **experimental methodology**, students were divided into an **experiment group** (provided with a supporting article) and a **control group**, with both groups surveyed before and after intervention. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

## 🎯 Research Objective

To evaluate:
> **"Are Learning Management Systems (LMS) useful for students in virtual learning environments?"**

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Design**: Pre-test/post-test with experimental and control groups  
- **Sample Size**: 7 graduate students (4 in experiment group, 3 in control group)  
- **Tool Used**: Survey via Google Forms  
- **Metrics**: Perceived Usefulness (PU1–PU4), Likert Scale responses  
- **Analysis**: Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error comparisons

## 📊 Key Results

| Group         | Mean (Before) | Mean (After) | Std Dev (After) | Std Error (After) |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Experiment    | 8              | **17**         | **0.56**          | **0.28**           |
| Control       | 12             | 12             | 2.45              | 1.32               |

> 🟢 **Conclusion**: The experiment group showed significant improvement in perception and satisfaction, confirming LMS usefulness.
